# My-Color-Finder-App

I AM CREATING AN APP THAT LETS THE USER INPUT A COLOR NAME, FROM THE RAINBOW, AND HAVE RANDOM COLORS WITHIN THAT FAMILY RETURNED AS HEX, HSL AND RGB VALUES. THE USER CAN THEN UTILIZE THE COLOR PICKER TO VERIFY THE COLOR CHOSEN. ADDITIONALLY, THE USER CAN OPEN THE COLOR PICKER, TO FIND A COLOR THAT WAY AS WELL. THIS IS HANDY FOR ANYONE NEEDING TO THROW IN A RANDOM COLOR OR SOMEONE WHO IS VISUAL AND WOULD LIKE TO SELECT A COLOR.
